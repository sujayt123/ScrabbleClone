upon register for account:
create a new Player in the table of players in the database
list of games in which user participates should initially be empty
generate a new salt for this user using the SecureRandom java object
store bcrypt(salt || password) in hashed_password field

upon login submission:
validate that bcrypt(salt || provided_password) == hashed_password[user]
Start a "session" that identifies the user to the server upon subsequent requests

user can select a game from games list, or select a new game from dropdown (vs AI, vs other player)

upon selection of new game:
submit request to server to create a new game (set 1player member of game to true depending on user selection)
server should create a new entry in the Game table
server should indicate in Player table that this player is participating in that game
client should "enter" the game
// set "current game" variable on client side to the game's unique ID returned by server

upon entering a game:
send back result of chosen game's "id" to the server
attach the current game id to the session

gameplay proceeds as normal except game logic is server side for the most part
